# Galaxy Classification

This just a short excercise performed over the course of a couple of hours of aggregating some image data of different galaxies in our universe and then doing some transfer learning to see how well we might be able to classify the different galaxies.

The images are pulled from Google Images and were very roughly pruned to help get rid of some noise.

Final dataset I put together and seen in this notebook can be found here: https://s3.amazonaws.com/galaxyclassification/data.zip
